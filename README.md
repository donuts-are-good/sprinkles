# sprinkles

## usage

you probably don't want to use this... yet. i have a few things about the way that comments are formatted in go. this tool cleanses a .go file of its wrongdoings and makes sure the comments are in order. there is no guarantee this wont destroy your work. it nuked its own code on the first step out of the gate, so don't be surprised. 

with that said, heres how you use sprinkles:

```
sprinkles main.go
```
